The previous AI engineer meticulously followed the user's requests, iteratively building the Kush Door application. Initially, a premium, full-screen landing page was crafted with an emphasis on visual design, glass-morphism, and specific typography. This AHA moment was crucial. Subsequently, the engineer expanded the application into a comprehensive multi-page SaaS platform, including navigation for Features, Dispensaries, Drivers, Pricing, and FAQ, all while maintaining consistent branding and design. The scope then extended to developing a robust, multi-step authentication system (Login and Signup). Most recently, the focus shifted to building a light-themed, multi-tenant dashboard with a dark sidebar and right-sliding detail cards, covering core functionalities like Orders and Products management, and is currently in the process of completing additional dashboard sections. The use of  for all imagery and  for efficient code generation were key recurring patterns.

The user requested a premium, immersive, high-converting landing page for Kush Door, a cannabis commerce SaaS. Key requirements included a full-screen canvas with a looping cannabis farm video background, a smoked glass gradient overlay, and non-scrollable initial state. The tone was to be Premium, Transparent, Local-empowered, and High-tech. Specific fonts (Unbounded, Manrope) were mandated. The page needed a floating transparent navbar, a left-aligned main text section with a bold headline Door to Dispensary. No App Needed., a supporting paragraph, and a Get Early Access CTA opening a modal for store name, email, and optional Stripe account. Decorative elements like floating vertical text and copyright were specified. A premium design framework emphasizing dramatic visual atmosphere, glass-morphism, subtle shadows, rounded corners, layered design, micro-animations, responsive design, and strategic color psychology (green, black, highlights) was a core demand.

Subsequently, the user requested the creation of additional navigation pages (Features, For Dispensaries, For Drivers, Pricing, FAQ) following the same premium design format, with SaaS-centric content. This was followed by a request for Login and Sign Up pages, again maintaining the established design and branding, including a multi-step signup process. The most recent major request was for a multi-tenant dashboard with a light background, retaining the green/gradient branding, featuring an app shell, fixed dark sidebar, sticky topbar, main content area, and crucial right-side sliding detail cards. Specific dashboard pages were outlined: Dashboard (overview cards, charts), Orders (table, sliding card details), Products (list, add/edit sliding card), Storefront, Drivers, Payments, Customers, Analytics, Support, and Settings, all requiring content and functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend Frameworks**: React, Next.js (implied, as common with Tailwind).
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for utility-first CSS, PostCSS.
- **Animations**: Framer Motion, GSAP, CSS animations.
- **Design Principles**: Glass-morphism, responsive design, visual hierarchy, color psychology.
- **Tools**:  for image sourcing,  for file operations.
- **Routing**: React Router for multi-page navigation.
- **User Experience**: Micro-interactions, accessibility (implied).

<code_architecture>
The application's codebase structure is centered around a React frontend, organized within the  directory.



-   ****: This is the most critical file, serving as the main React component. It has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development trajectory. Initially, it housed the entire landing page, including the hero section, navbar, and CTA modal. As new pages were requested (Features, For Dispensaries, For Drivers, Pricing, FAQ),  was updated to incorporate React Router for navigation and to render these new page components. Subsequently, login and signup pages were integrated here, managing multi-step forms and authentication UI. Most recently,  was completely refactored to serve as the core dashboard layout, handling the sidebar, topbar, main content area, and dynamically rendering different dashboard sections (Dashboard Home, Orders, Products, Storefront, Drivers) with their respective data and right-sliding detail cards. This file acts as the central hub for the entire application's frontend UI.
-   ****: This file contains the primary CSS rules specifically applied to the  component and its sub-components. It's crucial for defining custom styles, animations, and potentially the glass-morphism effects that are not directly handled by Tailwind utility classes.
-   ****: The entry point of the React application, responsible for rendering the  component into the DOM.
-   ****: Contains global CSS styles, including font imports (Unbounded, Manrope) and base styles, ensuring consistency across the entire application.
-   ****: Configures Tailwind CSS, allowing for custom themes, colors, font families, and extending default utility classes. This file is vital for maintaining the bespoke premium design, glass-morphism blur values, and specific color palette.
-   ****: Stores environment variables like , crucial for API interactions and preventing hardcoding of URLs.
-   ****: Manages project dependencies (React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Router, etc.) and defines scripts for development and building.

The architecture follows a single-page application (SPA) pattern using React Router for navigation, with a strong emphasis on component reusability and Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on building out the comprehensive content and functionality for the various sections within the new light-themed dashboard.

Specifically, the **Orders Management** and **Products Catalog** sections of the dashboard have been completed.
For **Orders Management**:
-   Order statistics cards (Pending, In Transit, Delivered Today, Total Revenue) are displayed.
-   A comprehensive table lists recent cannabis orders with details like Order IDs, customer info, product names (e.g., Blue Dream, OG Kush), status (Pending, En-route, Preparing, Delivered, Cancelled) with professional color-coded badges, driver assignments, and delivery addresses.
-   An advanced right-sliding card provides detailed views on order click, showing complete customer information, a detailed itemized breakdown of cannabis products, and order management actions (Update Status, Contact Customer, Assign Driver).

For **Products Catalog**:
-   Product statistics (Total Products, Active, Low Stock, Out of Stock) are presented.
-   A professional product table displays cannabis-specific data including product names with emojis, categories (Flower, Edibles, Pre-Rolls, Concentrates), strain types (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid), THC/CBD percentages, and stock levels with color-coded warnings.
-   Advanced product management is enabled via right-sliding cards for Add Product (with full form for name, category, strain, THC/CBD, price, stock, description) and Edit Product (showing visual product display, specifications, and action buttons).

The design maintains the light theme consistency, green brand accents, professional cards with subtle shadows, and cannabis industry-specific branding including emojis and appropriate imagery. Interactive elements like smooth right-sliding cards, hover states, status badges, and consistent action buttons are implemented. The overall dashboard experience is designed to be professional, intuitive, and ready for production, providing a world-class cannabis commerce solution.
