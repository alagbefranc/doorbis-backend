The previous AI engineer began by developing a premium landing page, then expanded it into a multi-page SaaS application, and subsequently implemented multi-step authentication. The core focus shifted to building a light-themed, multi-tenant dashboard with comprehensive sections for Orders and Products management. A significant pivot occurred when the user highlighted the backend's incompleteness, prompting the AI to build a full FastAPI backend from scratch, including authentication and all dashboard APIs, successfully populating it with sample data. Most recently, the AI has been integrating this fully functional backend with the frontend, addressing issues like syntax errors, missing components, and correct authentication flow. The integration process hit a snag with the frontend not fully displaying real data or enabling button functionality, which the AI is actively resolving by systematically connecting the frontend components to the robust backend API.

The Kush Door application was initially envisioned as a premium, high-converting cannabis commerce SaaS landing page, featuring a full-screen video background, glass-morphism, specific typography (Unbounded, Manrope), and a Get Early Access CTA with a multi-step modal. The design emphasizes a Premium, Transparent, Local-empowered, High-tech tone with subtle shadows, rounded corners, layered design, micro-animations, and a green/black/highlights color palette.

Subsequently, the scope expanded to include additional navigation pages (Features, Dispensaries, Drivers, Pricing, FAQ) maintaining the premium design. A robust multi-step Login and Sign Up system was then integrated. The most recent requirement was for a multi-tenant dashboard with a light background, green branding, a dark sidebar, sticky topbar, and right-sliding detail cards. Specific dashboard sections required full functionality: Dashboard overview, Orders, Products, Storefront, Drivers, Payments, Customers, Analytics, Support, and Settings. The application aims to provide a professional, intuitive, and production-ready solution for the cannabis commerce industry.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Framer Motion, React Router.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, MongoDB (for database), JWT (for authentication).
- **Design Principles**: Glass-morphism, responsive design, component reusability.
- **Tools**:  (for images),  (for file operations),  (for backend testing).
- **Architecture**: Single-Page Application (SPA) using React Router, multi-tenant backend.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application features a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



- ****: Critical as the main React component, it has been heavily refactored. Initially a landing page, it evolved to integrate React Router for multi-page navigation (Features, Pricing, etc.), then authentication (Login/Signup), and now serves as the core dashboard layout. It dynamically renders different dashboard sections and handles routing. Recent changes include integrating authentication routing via  and attempting to connect dashboard components to the backend API.
- ****: The central FastAPI application file. It imports and registers all API routes from the  directory, establishes database connection (MongoDB), and defines global application hooks. Recent significant changes involved integrating new authentication and dashboard routes and fixing import paths.
- ****: Newly created files defining MongoDB document schemas (e.g., , , , etc.) using Pydantic for validation and type hinting, crucial for data structure and persistence.
- ****: New files defining specific API endpoints for each module (e.g., , , ). They handle request parsing, business logic, and database interactions. Extensive refactoring to use absolute imports and proper database dependency injection.
- ****: A newly created file designed to centralize all API calls from the frontend to the backend, ensuring consistent  usage and token management for authenticated requests.
- ****: A new React Context file to manage the global authentication state (e.g., user login status, token). It provides a provider component to wrap the application and expose authentication functionalities.
- ****: A new script responsible for populating the MongoDB database with realistic sample data for all entities (users, products, orders, customers, drivers, payments, support tickets). This is vital for testing the full application with live data.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on fully integrating the frontend dashboard with the newly built and fully functional FastAPI backend. The backend is confirmed to be 100% complete with a JWT-based authentication system, all API endpoints for dashboard modules (Products, Orders, Customers, Drivers, Payments, Analytics, Support, Settings), and populated with comprehensive live sample data (e.g., owner@greenvalley.com / password123, 6 products, 5 customers, 4 orders, etc.).

On the frontend, the AI had created the necessary infrastructure for integration, including:
-    for centralized API calls.
-    for authentication state management.
-    for user login.

The  file has been partially updated to handle authentication routing. Initial attempts to connect dashboard components, specifically the Products section, encountered syntax errors. These errors were identified and fixed. Subsequently, missing page components referenced in routes were added to resolve rendering issues.

The login page () is now visibly working and displays the sample credentials. However, the authentication flow still requires proper connection, as logging in does not currently redirect to the dashboard, and dashboard sections are not yet fetching real data, meaning buttons and charts remain non-functional. The AI has reverted previous temporary demo bypasses and is currently ensuring a proper, real authentication integration.

Test the login functionality by performing a manual login action via the UI.
